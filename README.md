osmapi is a client for the [OSM API 0.6](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6) written in Kotlin

This library a fork of https://github.com/westnordost/osmapi for Kotlin MultiPlatform (KMP)

The OSM API, particularly the part to download the map data, is intended only for editing the map. It's not made for pulling larger amounts of data or data analysis of certain map features. If this is what you intend to do, the Overpass API is what you will want to use
